Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 1 session / week, 1 hour / session

Labs: 2 sessions / week  
Lab 1: 3-4 hours / session  
Lab 2: 3-4 hours / session  

Attendance
----------

It is required that you attend all lectures. Exams will cover lecture and lab material.

This is a relatively fast-paced lab course. For this reason, **Lab Attendance is required of all students in each group**. Attendance will be taken, and lab attendance will be counted as part of the lab grade. If there is a reason you cannot make it to lab, you must contact

1.  your lab TA and
2.  at least one member of your lab group prior to the lab period.

References
----------

Suggested Readings will be given in the Lab Handouts in lecture or the lab.

Other material may be given to you in the form of handouts from books during the course.
