  caption: A three-dimensional view of a polystyrene domain in polystyrene/polybutadiene
    triblock copolymer. The computer graphic, reconstructed from transmission electron
    micrographs, shows the packing sequence and individual deviations in the microstructure
    of an ultrathin copolymer film. (Image courtesy of LBL Research Review, Vol. 12,
