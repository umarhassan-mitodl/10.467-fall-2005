description: A three-dimensional view of a polystyrene domain in polystyrene/polybutadiene
  triblock copolymer. The computer graphic, reconstructed from transmission electron
  micrographs, shows the packing sequence and individual deviations in the microstructure
  of an ultrathin copolymer film. (Image courtesy of LBL Research Review, Vol. 12,
